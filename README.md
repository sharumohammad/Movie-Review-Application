User Management: Register, login.

Movie Management: Add, retrieve movies.

Review Management: Create, read, update, delete reviews for movies.

RESTful API: Provides a clean and consistent API for client interaction.

Data Validation: Ensures data integrity for all incoming requests.

Technologies Used
Java: Programming language.

Maven: Dependency management and build automation tool.

Spring Boot: Framework for building robust, stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

Spring Data JPA: Simplifies data access using JPA (Java Persistence API).

Lombok: Library to reduce boilerplate code (e.g., getters, setters, constructors).

MySQL: Relational database for storing application data.

Tomcat (Embedded): Default embedded server provided by Spring Boot.

Postman: Used for API testing and documentation.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

JDK 11 or higher

Maven 3.6.x or higher

MySQL Server (and a MySQL client like MySQL Workbench or DBeaver for database setup)

Postman (Optional, but recommended for API testing)

Setup Instructions
Database Setup
Create Database:
Open your MySQL client and execute the following SQL command to create a new database for the application:

CREATE DATABASE movie_review_db;

Configure application.properties:
Navigate to src/main/resources/application.properties in your project and configure the database connection details. Replace your_mysql_username and your_mysql_password with your actual MySQL credentials.

# Server configuration
server.port=8080

# Spring Data JPA and Hibernate configuration
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.show-sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect

# MySQL Database Connection
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/movie_review_db?useSSL=false&serverTimezone=UTC
spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update: This setting will automatically create or update your database schema based on your JPA entities. For production environments, it's often set to validate or none with manual schema management.

Running the Application
Clone the Repository (if applicable):
If your project is in a Git repository, clone it:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd movie-review-application

Build the Project:
Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of your project (where pom.xml is located) and run the Maven clean and install command:

mvn clean install

This will compile the project, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file.

Run the Spring Boot Application:
After a successful build, you can run the application using the Spring Boot Maven plugin:

mvn spring-boot:run

Alternatively, you can run the generated JAR file:

java -jar target/movie-review-application.jar # Replace 'movie-review-application.jar' with your actual JAR file name

The application will start on the port configured in application.properties (default: 8080). You should see logs indicating that Tomcat has started.
